* Hi there!
You're reading my blog.

Ok, so what? Well, I made a huge fuss about /never/ making a blog. But after /over a year of being bothered about it/, I finally did! Good job guys! ðŸ¤£

So, why? Well, it's because uploading =org= files in raw format to my [[https://www.github.com/summeremacs][Github account]] was looking kinda shoddy. And, as many people know, I do NOT like to look shoddy.

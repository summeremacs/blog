Hi there!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re reading my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, so what? Well, I made a huge fuss about &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; making a blog. But after &lt;em&gt;over a year of being bothered about it&lt;/em&gt;, I finally did! Good job guys! 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, why? Well, it&amp;#39;s because uploading &lt;code class=&#34;verbatim&#34;&gt;org&lt;/code&gt; files in raw format to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.github.com/summeremacs&#34;&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt; was looking kinda shoddy. And, as many people know, I do &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; like to look shoddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, it was prompted by a few comments online (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://lobste.rs/s/2hswwc/how_i_came_use_emacs_other_things&#34;&gt;here for instance&lt;/a&gt;) which just made me hide my face in my hands 🤦🏼‍♀️ and say ok…screw it. I&amp;#39;ll make a blog. But I didn&amp;#39;t wanna pay for a Squarespace or something like that because anyone with 1/4 of a brain can do that and &amp;#34;make a blog&amp;#34;. Instead, since I was posting about Emacs stuff (mostly), I wanted it to be where I can get geek cred: 👩🏼‍💻 on Github. So, I had to set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo&#34;&gt;easy-hugo&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I linked to a Mac 🍏 version. Bite me! 😀), and then I had to look through tons of bad themes to find a good one and figure out how to set that up, and boy was that not easy to do!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline-text-headline-1&#34; class=&#34;outline-text-2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re reading my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok, so what? Well, I made a huge fuss about &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; making a blog. But after &lt;em&gt;over a year of being bothered about it&lt;/em&gt;, I finally did! Good job guys! 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, I &amp;#34;made it work&amp;#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven&amp;#39;t finished. I do have a DNS to tie to it but I don&amp;#39;t think that I&amp;#39;ll bother for now. I just want it to park stuff I&amp;#39;ve already written and maybe will write about every few months or year or so. We&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At least it doesn&amp;#39;t look as shoddy 🗑️ as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Summer ⭐️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
